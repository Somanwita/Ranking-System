EPL Ranking System

## Getting Started

In the project, data of the matches conducted this season have been used. There are a total of 20 teams. Ideally, each team plays 19 matches on home ground and 19 matches away. But due to COVID-19 not all the matches took place so for those matches we tacked this by predicting the outcomes of future football matches by using the past match outcome data.
